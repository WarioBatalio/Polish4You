            <p>Being Czech native speaker, I am facing specific issues with learning Polish as these languages are quite similar.
                Anna perfectly assessed my skills and was able to tailor the lessons to the topics and grammar I need.
                <b>Her lessons are interactive, variable, I never get bored. She is always prepared for the lesson and I feel that I get a high quality service.</b>
                Anna helped me also to understand better Poland and Polish people.</p>
